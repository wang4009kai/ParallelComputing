Enter "make" inside the same directory where the MakeFile presents to compile the code (or directly use nvcc -o assignemnt2 assignment2.cu).
Enter "make run" to run the program.
Enter "make clean" to clean the assignment2.o file generated by the nvcc.

Note: For the degree of polynomial please enter a number at max 10 (2^10) due to the memeory allocation where (2n -1)*n * sizeof(int) is needed to store the result array, anything above 2^10 will make the kernal non launchable.
Thus returning the incorrect output. 
Explain: (2n -1) is the number of terms after two polynomials multiply together, each of them will have a space of n, and they will store int inside. The actual reason why the kernal won't launch have not being identifying due to time 
limit, however since the code is able to reach the minimal requirement 2^10, thus it's left as it is.

Using instruction:
1.When asked to enter degree of polynomial please enter a number smaller than or equal to 10.
2.When asked to enter the threads per block please enter a number that is a multiples of 2 (32, 64 etc).

Detailed comments and explaination please see the inline comments.
